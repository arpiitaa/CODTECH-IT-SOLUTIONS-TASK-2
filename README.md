OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

DATASET : https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240307152534/framingham.csv

1. Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes and save lives. This project aims to develop a predictive model using logistic regression to determine the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various health parameters.

2. Objective
The primary objective is to build a logistic regression model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The model will be trained on a dataset containing patient health records and will use various features to make predictions.

3. Dataset
The dataset used for this project typically includes the following features:

Age: Age of the patient.
Sex: Gender of the patient.
Chest Pain Type (cp): Type of chest pain experienced.
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): Blood pressure (in mm Hg) while at rest.
Cholesterol (chol): Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): Blood sugar level > 120 mg/dl.
Resting ECG (restecg): Resting electrocardiographic results.
Max Heart Rate (thalach): Maximum heart rate achieved.
Exercise Induced Angina (exang): Exercise-induced angina.
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
Number of Major Vessels (ca): Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
Thal: Thalassemia (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect).
Target: Presence of heart disease (1) or absence of heart disease (0).

4. Methodology:
   
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Development:
Train a logistic regression model using the training dataset.
Use various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score to evaluate the model.

Model Evaluation:
Assess the modelâ€™s performance on the testing set.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

Feature Importance:
Analyze the significance of each feature in predicting heart disease.

Model Optimization:
Fine-tune the model parameters using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.

Deployment:
Develop a user-friendly interface where users can input health parameters to get predictions.
Integrate the model into a web application using frameworks like Flask or Django.

5. Expected Outcomes
A trained logistic regression model capable of predicting the presence of heart disease with high accuracy.
An understanding of which health parameters significantly contribute to the risk of heart disease.
A user interface for easy interaction with the model.

7. Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
IDE: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm
Frameworks for Deployment: Flask or Django

9. Conclusion
By leveraging logistic regression, this project aims to provide a reliable tool for predicting heart disease, which can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improve patient care.

10. Future Work
Explore other machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks for potentially better performance.
Include more features and larger datasets for improved accuracy.
Integrate with real-time health monitoring systems for continuous prediction and monitoring.
This project not only demonstrates the application of logistic regression in healthcare but also underscores the importance of predictive analytics in modern medicine.
